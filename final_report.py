#Write a domain function that counts the number of subdomains.
#How many subdomains did you find in the ics.uci.edu domain? Submit the list of subdomains ordered alphabetically
# and the number of unique pages detected in each subdomain. The content of this list should be lines containing URL,
# number, for example:
#http://vision.ics.uci.edu, 10 (not the actual number here)
def count_domain(subdomain) -> int:

#Write a unique page function.
#How many unique pages did you find? Uniqueness for the purposes of this assignment is ONLY established by the URL,
# but discarding the fragment part. So, for example, http://www.ics.uci.edu#aaa and http://www.ics.uci.edu#bbb are
# the same URL. Even if you implement additional methods for textual similarity detection, please keep considering
# the above definition of unique pages for the purposes of counting the unique pages in this assignment.
